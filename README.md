# Penrose Tiling

A web page that generates Penrose tiling. More info can be found on wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling

The approach to generate the tiling used here is known as triangle decomposition. We start with a triangle, or a few that form a nice starting shape, and divide it recursively, at each step spliting one side according to golden ratio rule.
